## Supported engines

`core-js` tries to support all possible JS engines and environments with ES3
support. Some features have a higher lower bar - for example, _some_ accessors
can properly work only from ES5, promises require a way to set a microtask or a
task, etc.

However, I have no possibility to test `core-js` absolutely everywhere - for
example, testing in IE7- and some other ancient was stopped. The list of
definitely supported engines you can see in the compatibility table below.
[Write](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues) if you have issues or
questions with the support of any engine.

## About `core-js-compat`

`core-js` project provides (as
[`core-js-compat`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/tree/master/packages/core-js-compat)
package) all required data about the necessity of `core-js` modules, entry
points, and tools for work with it - it's useful for integration with tools like
`babel` or `swc`. If you wanna help, you could take a look at the related
section of [Contributing](dev/README.md#how-to-update-core-js-compat-data).
