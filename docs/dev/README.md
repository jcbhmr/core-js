# How to contribute

Contributions are always welcome. Feel free to ask [**@zloirock**](https://github.com/zloirock) if you have some questions.

## I want to help with code, but I don't know how

There is always some ["help wanted" issues](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). You can look at them first. Sure, other help is also required - you could ask [**@zloirock**](https://github.com/zloirock) about it or open issues if you have some ideas.
