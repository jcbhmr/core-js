# Features

This chapter describes all the polyfill supported by Core-JS, which are grouped into three broad categories:

- [ECMAScript Standards](es-standard/README.md)
- [ECMAScript Proposals](es-proposal/README.md)
- [Web standards](web-standard/README.md)

Some features are not polyfill for some reason, for more information please see [Missing Ployfills](./missing-polyfills.md)

In addition, Core-JS provides some helper functions, you can find them here: [Helpers](./helper/README.md)
