# What is core-js?

- It is a polyfill of the JavaScript standard library, which supports:
  - The latest ECMAScript standard.
  - ECMAScript standard library proposals.
  - Some WHATWG / W3C standards (cross-platform or closely related ECMAScript).
- It is maximally modular: you can easily choose to load only the features you will be using.
- It can be used without polluting the global namespace.
- It is tightly integrated with `babel`: this allows many optimizations of `core-js` import.
